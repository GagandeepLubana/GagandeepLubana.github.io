            A graphical Tic Tac Toe game with two modes. The player will be able
            to select who to play against, either another player, or the AI. The
            AI boasts logical moves and random moves which makes it very hard to
            beat while keeping the algorithm's complexity to the minimum. This
            program uses the pygame library to display the game's functions in a
            GUI rather than the command-line or the web.

          <p>
            Many find it time-consuming and difficult to practice and improve
            their typing skills. This typing speed test is a great way to start
            practicing and improving a person's typing skills. Personally, I
            used typeracer.com to practice my typing which is why a lot of the
            features of this program are similart to typeracer. This program
            includes features that improve a person's accuracy greatly and it
            precisely outputs the speed (Net WPM) with no sidecurves real-time!

          <p>
            In our modern world people are constantly worried about their
            credentials and privacy. Well, I got you covered on that one with
            this program. It allows you to check how many times a password has
            been breached in the past from data attacks on companies. The
            application uses the concepts of the SHAH-1 algorithm and
            K-Anonimity to sensitively retrieve information from the 'Have I
            Been Pwned' API without any lack of sensitivity and privacy.

          <p>
            This program can tell any atmospherical information to the user of
            any location. The program uses web scraping to obtain the
            information required for the location. This program uses the
            T-kinter library which consists of simplistic design and its retro
            look for GUI development. Keeping the website's TOS and PP in mind,
            the information is acquired from weather.com.

          <h2>TinkerCAD & Arduino (Vacuum Robot)</h2>
          <p>
            Using circuits and arduino code I created a smart vacuum robot in
            TinkerCAD. This shows my skill and experience in electronics and
            robotics, as well as coding robots. The robot is able to go forward
            and reverse based on the outputs of the sensors. The sensors detect
            stairs, walls, objects, and any moving objects and react based on
            the information given.

          <h2>TinkerCAD & Arduino (RC Airplane)</h2>
          <p>
            I created the electronic template and functions of a RC airplane in
            TinkerCAD. I used Arduino to code the logic of the RC airplane and
            the Arduino board for the electronics. This further shows my skill
            and experience in electronics and robotics, as well as coding
            robots. The robot is able to behave just like a real RC airplane
            (controllable ailerons, elevator, rudder). Potentiometers are used
            to give inputs to the Arduino board and they act as the controller
            like in real life.
