						<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe with AI</h2>
						<p>A graphical Tic Tac Toe game with two modes. The player will be able to select who to play against, either another player, or the AI. The AI boasts logical moves and random moves which makes it very hard to beat while keeping the algorithm's complexity to the minimum. This program uses the pygame library to display the game's functions in a GUI rather than the command-line or the web.</p>Code: <a href="https://github.com/GagandeepLubana/TicTacToe-with-AI">TicTacToe-With-AI</a>

						<h2>Typing Speed Test</h2>
						<p>Many find it time-consuming and difficult to practice and improve their typing skills. This typing speed test is a great way to start practicing and improving a person's typing skills. Personally, I used typeracer.com to practice my typing which is why a lot of the features of this program are similart to typeracer. This program includes features that improve a person's accuracy greatly and it precisely outputs the speed (Net WPM) with no sidecurves real-time!</p>

				    	<h2>Password Checker GUI</h2>
				    	<p>In our modern world people are constantly worried about their credentials and privacy. Well, I got you covered on that one with this program. It allows you to check how many times a password has been breached in the past from data attacks on companies. The application uses the concepts of the SHAH-1 algorithm and K-Anonimity to sensitively retrieve information from the 'Have I Been Pwned' API without any lack of sensitivity and privacy.</p>

						<h2>Weather App</h2>
						<p>This program can tell any atmospherical information to the user of any location. The program uses web scraping to obtain the information required for the location. This program uses the T-kinter library which consists of simplistic design and its retro look for GUI development. Keeping the website's TOS and PP in mind, the information is acquired from weather.com.</p>
