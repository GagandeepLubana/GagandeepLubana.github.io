						<h2>URide</h2>
						<p>A web app which allows for bike routing and near bike-sharing information. Used Leaflet library
							to embed geographical functionlity on OpenStreetMap provided bike map. Makes use GraphHopper
							
							Routing Engine to find bike routes and Nominatim Geocoding service for address-coordinate function-
							ality. Leverages CitiBik API data to display nearest bike-sharing services with deatailed information.</p>

						<h2>Tic-Tac-Toe with AI</h2>
						<p>A graphical Tic Tac Toe game with two modes. The player will be able to select who to play against, either another player, or the AI. The AI boasts logical moves and random moves which makes it very hard to beat while keeping the algorithm's complexity to the minimum. This program uses the pygame library to display the game's functions in a GUI rather than the command-line or the web.

						<h2>Typing Speed Test</h2>
						<p>Many find it time-consuming and difficult to practice and improve their typing skills. This typing speed test is a great way to start practicing and improving a person's typing skills. Personally, I used typeracer.com to practice my typing which is why a lot of the features of this program are similart to typeracer. This program includes features that improve a person's accuracy greatly and it precisely outputs the speed (Net WPM) with no sidecurves real-time!</p>

				    	<h2>Password Checker GUI</h2>
				    	<p>In our modern world people are constantly worried about their credentials and privacy. Well, I got you covered on that one with this program. It allows you to check how many times a password has been breached in the past from data attacks on companies. The application uses the concepts of the SHAH-1 algorithm and K-Anonimity to sensitively retrieve information from the 'Have I Been Pwned' API without any lack of sensitivity and privacy.</p>

						<h2>Weather App</h2>
						<p>This program can tell any atmospherical information to the user of any location. The program uses web scraping to obtain the information required for the location. This program uses the T-kinter library which consists of simplistic design and its retro look for GUI development. Keeping the website's TOS and PP in mind, the information is acquired from weather.com.</p>

						<h2>Audio Visualizer (Processing)</h2>
						<p>An audio visualzer created with Processing in Java. Multiple backgrounds presented. Additionally, a variety of colour profiles for each effect. Used FFT and amplitude to create the visualizer.</p>

						<h2>TinkerCAD & Arduino (Vacuum Robot)</h2>
						<p>Using circuits and arduino code I created a smart vacuum robot in TinkerCAD. This shows my skill and experience in electronics and robotics, as well as coding robots. The robot is able to go forward and reverse based on the outputs of the sensors. The sensors detect stairs, walls, objects, and any moving objects and react based on the information given.</p>

						<h2>TinkerCAD & Arduino (RC Airplane)</h2>
						<p>I created the electronic template and functions of a RC airplane in TinkerCAD. I used Arduino to code the logic of the RC airplane and the Arduino board for the electronics. This further shows my skill and experience in electronics and robotics, as well as coding robots. The robot is able to behave just like a real RC airplane (controllable ailerons, elevator, rudder). Potentiometers are used to give inputs to the Arduino board and they act as the controller like in real life.</p>

						<h2>Scratch Naruto Game</h2>
						<p>I created a scratch game about my favourite anime Naruto. I used the concept of sprites and interchanging them based on the character's movement. I used objects detection for the knives. Furthermore, I used colour detection to prevevnt the character from going away from the path. I also incorporated a small story to make the game interesting.</p>
